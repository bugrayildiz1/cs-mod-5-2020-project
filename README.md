# Template for the CS MOD 5 project in 2020

Welcome to Team 22!  
We believe that this project is a great solution for the ones that would like to create a more relaxing or party environment at their place. The target customer is going to be anyone that wants to have a smart home system that controls the lighting of a LED strip depending on a set of criteria. The system is supposed to be user-friendly and easy to be used once the user is given a small introduction on how to use the system (learnability).  
Scope: Implementing a simple smart home system with one light sensor (photoresistor), a user interface (physical/digital) and a LED light strip which is synchronized with the colors of the pixels of a video on a display or with the rhythm of the music .
