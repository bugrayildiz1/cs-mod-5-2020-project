## **Q1:** What are the things that went well during the last sprint? 
* **Planning of the project**
During the last sprint we managed to come up with a simple design and technical plan of development for our project
* **All the deadlines were met**
All the requirements were set up accordingly and all the project-related assignments were finished in time.
* **Physical and online meetings**
The communication among the team members was on point and highly efficient, as our team met up both physically and online multiple times.  
* **Presentation**
According to the Socrative feedback, people liked our presentation and gave us positive comments (regarding slides, presenters, planning, etc.). 


## **Q2:** What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
* **Communication between subteams**
Sometimes there was lack of communication between subteams, so that one person already started researching and another person was not aware of that. This is something we should improve in sprint 2.
* **We could make our planning better**
It is quite difficult to plan the points that we are going to do during the implementation period. We had to do our planning better and with more details.
* **Time management**
Sometimes we did not spend that much time on the project as was planned in the project manual.
* **Visualisation during presentation**
According to Socrative feedback, some people suggested we show more pictures to make it easier to understand what exactly we are talking about.


## **Q3:** What did you learn during the last sprint on a….


### ***a)***   Domain specific level?
* **Sensor**
For the start we had to learn how we could start a system with the help of a sensor, in or case a LDR. 
* **Mounting the LED strip**
We discussed several options to mount the LED strip to the back side of TV/Desktop screens. The main requirement was to come up with a way we attach the strip so it is appropriate for any size and type of displays. Thus, we found out that the average size of the TV screens is about 40 inches and for that we need a minimum of 3 meters and preferably 5 meters of the LED strip. Further research and ideas will be needed to find a technical solution on how we can set up the LED strip onto the monitors.
* **LED**
The main add-on piece of hardware is going to be a LED strip, so we did some research on how LEDs work and whenever we can control each of the lights individually. We also covered some documentation on the synchronization of the lights with data that is retrieved from the sound played by the Pi or its video output.
* **UI**
We discussed and pitched our ideas on how we should control the Pi with the help of a digital UI. We improved our knowledge in developing an optimized front-end and back-end of a web application that is going to be used as the UI.


### ***b)***   Intra-personal level?
* **Come to compromise** 
During two weeks of the sprint, we have mastered effectively listening to each other, with highlighting the main ideas to combine them into a one major conclusion, leaving every team member satisfied with a final decision. 
* **Resolution of misunderstandings**
We have no problems with clarifying the situations between our team mates, since we all realize that communication is the key for effective team work. 


## **Q4:** What are your plans for the next sprint?
* **Mockup and design**
For the next sprint we will make a mockup of our user interface, which will be included in the next presentation to serve as a demo. Moreover, we will start designing technical aspects and in particular, an abstraction of how our data will flow in our system. 
* **Sourcing and Research**
We plan on sourcing the LED strip and other materials, in addition to doing research into other technical aspects.
* **First integrations**
We will also try to present the first shippable increment by starting to develop our various subsystems and even try to interconnect these. When this is done, a very rudimental system should be operable.
* **Physical demo**
With a bit of luck, we can also demonstrate this rudementral system.
## **Q5:** Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.
| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| :---------------------------------: | :----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5) |  |
| **Happy  (4)** | Since we have quite a lot of new members, we do not yet operate as an oiled machine. Nevertheless, things are moving on quickly and everyone is skilled enough to work on an appropriate level. |
| Okay  (3) |  |
| Sad  (2) |  |
| Very  Sad (1) |  |


## **Q6:** Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
**Jasper van Amerongen**: We appreciate his work as a scrum master and also being presenter during sprint 1 final presentation. 


## **Q7:** Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)?
* **Minimal viable product**
We can prioritize our idea for the “minimal viable product” which is connecting LDR to the Raspberry Pi and analyze the light level to control the LED strip.
* **Expand requirements**
In this period, we are planning to finish that first and then we are going to expand our project requirements with some other ideas and features that we have, e.g. adding ambient light or music responsive light specialities.
* **Collecting the tools**
We need to collect the tools that we need to use to start for our minimal viable product. That’s why we prioritize listing the sensors and the hardware kit that we are going to use to order online.
* **Working remotely**
We need to make sure that we figure out how  we can work on a physical product, whilst working online and not being able to interact with said system (apart from through the Internet).
