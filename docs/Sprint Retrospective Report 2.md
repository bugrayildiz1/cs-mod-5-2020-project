## Q1: What are the things that went well during the last sprint?
* **The amount of progress that we had**
Since we had a nice planning for this sprint, we have done a considerable amount of work according to the previous sprint.
* **Better productivity**
Every group member had a nice design for what they were going to do in the next sprint. That will cause more effective upcoming sprints.
* **Better communication between the group members**
There was a good amount of participation for the group meetings. Every group member was updated via the communication within our Whatsapp group.
* **User interface mockup design**
We had a nice mockup design for the user interface of the system which aims to be user-friendly and aesthetic.
* **Presentation**
The explanations that we had during the presentation and the demo of the user interface were clear and impressive. 
## Q2: What are the things that could have gone better during the last sprint?
* **Better planning**
At the beginning of the sprint, we were planning to start implementing the both backend and frontend of the system. We have to do better and more detailed planning.
* **Time management**
Unfortunately we could not respect the deadlines that we set at the beginning of the sprint. Next time, we are going to respect the deadlines with better planning.
* **UI design of the system**
We had a nice mockup design. However, we could start implementing it and make it responsive for the sprint presentation.
* **Better presentation**
Our explanations have been indicated clearly. However, we could explain “what we are going to do” and “what we did” a bit more detailed.
* **Better communication**
Still some sub-teams in our team sometimes are living their own lifes and the rest of a team has no idea on what they are working, so we definitely have to improve it.
## Q3: What did you learn during the last sprint on a….
### a) Domain specific level?
* **User Interface**
We figured out which type of design system that we were going to use for the user interface of the system to make it efficient, attractive and user-friendly as much as possible.
* **Connected LED Strip and PSU**
Not many team members had the knowledge about electrical circuits and soldering. This is something that we now taught ourselves and now the PSU can drive the LEDs perfectly.
* **Server on Raspberry Pi**
We acquainted ourselves with how to install Tomcat server specifically on Raspberry Pi and how to deploy an existing project. 
### b) intra-personal level?
* **Solving conflicts within the team**
We were able to discuss and solve the problems that we had within the team via communication.
* **Meeting up online**
During the last week our team has faced serious problems regarding communication as we had been forced to fastly change to online meetings only as members of our team had serious health problems (COVID :-)). This has been a challenge, since working on the physical layer turned out to be challenging.
## Q4: What are your plans for the next sprint?
* **Focusing on minimal viable product that we are going to have**
We’ll focus our efforts at the start of the next sprint towards achieving a usable minimal viable product as soon as possible. 
* **Finish the most part of the user interface of the system**
We will focus on finishing the implementation of the settings page and palette page. 
* **Connect the LEDs to the Raspberry Pi**
We want to have a working prototype of the LEDs with the Raspberry Pi. We are going to connect the cables of the LED strip to the power supply and the pi..
* **Having a solid backend**
We are going to try to implement the Tomcat server of the system and try to deploy the project on Intellij to run it locally.
* **Improve our productivity overall**
For the last sprints due to the exams, resits or some external factors we are not paying that much attention to the project, as we will have much more time on it soon, we have to put all efforts to make good progress.
## Q5: Select your team performance and satisfaction score from the following. Don’t forget to justify your answer.
| **Satisfaction-level  and Value** | **Justification** |
| :---------------------------------: | :----------------- |
| Very  Happy (5) |  |
| Happy  (4)*| |
| **Okay  (3)** |  We did not have that much of a process due to exams and resits, however we did some work and we are on the way to our minimal viable product|
| Sad  (2) |  |
| Very  Sad (1) |  |
## Q6: Which team member was most appreciated during the last sprint (only list 1) and why?
**Bugra Veysel Yildiz**: We appreciate his work as a scrum master during sprint 2.

## Q7: Would you like to specify any other priority detail(s)/points which could be useful for the development of your product (if any)
We have some points in our project which have higher priority than others. We want to connect the tools that we have collected for our project to the Raspberry Pi. We need to figure out how to connect cables from the LED strip to the and pins on the pi and the power supply . After that, we want to finish our minimal viable product which is connecting the LDR with the LEDs to work on the Raspberry Pi. In that way, we can examine the data that the sensor reads and then have a solid idea on how to use that data for the other features that we are going to implement.
