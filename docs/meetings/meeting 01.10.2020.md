## Short overview:

### We were concentrated on the exam we had right before stand up meeting.Front end team did nice mock of the user interface they will start implementing.
### We finnally came up with main programming language of our project, therefore back end team can start working. Physical layer team will get LED strip and will try to work with it for the first time.
