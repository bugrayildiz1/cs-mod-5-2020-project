## Short overview:

### At this part we started getting problems with understanding how to make the whole system work, which data is stored, which data flows from UI to pi and most important- how to implement the system that will manage it.
### Jasper got sick, we are waiting for test on Corona, so team should be able in the future to work harder due to missing one team member for some period of time.
### The physical meeting(except Jasper) is planned for tuesday, 13th october
