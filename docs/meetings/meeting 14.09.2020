Short overview:

•This was our first proper team meeting after the formation of the team. 
•Since today we are getting started with the project and therefore have to be 
 familiar with the project manual, all upcoming deadlines and things we have to
 finish for successful passing, which are mentioned there.
•Also, we have to think about the type of application for the project to start 
 implementing it as soon as possible and be ready with that till September 18, 
 17:00 (deadline)
•Therefore, a group meeting was planned on Wednesday at 20:00 to discuss ideas 
 for the project and pick the best one. 
•GitLab repository and jira were discussed and should set up for the project 
 matters as soon as possible.
•Stand-up meeting reports were also discussed, namely whether they should be 
 done after every meeting or not and where they should be uploaded.
