## Short overview:

 ### This was our first proper team meeting after the formation of the team. 
 ### Since today we are getting started with the project and therefore have to be 
 ### familiar with the project manual, all upcoming deadlines and things we have to
 ### finish for successful passing, which are mentioned there.
 ### Also, we have to think about the type of application for the project to start 
 ### implementing it as soon as possible and be ready with that till September 18, 
 ### 17:00 (deadline)
 ### Therefore, a group meeting was planned on Wednesday at 20:00 to discuss ideas 
 ### for the project and pick the best one. 
 ### GitLab repository and jira were discussed and should set up for the project 
 ### matters as soon as possible.
 ### Stand-up meeting reports were also discussed, namely whether they should be 
 ### done after every meeting or not and where they should be uploaded.
