## Short overview:

### During this week we had an exam for computer architecture and organisation, that is why all of us concentrated on preparation to it.
### We will have to finish sprint 1 retrospective report by monday.
### We will have to set the plan of the work for future sprint
### For now, when there are mainly group work assignment, we all have same tasks to do, so we are waiting for next sprint to divide our work and start actual implementation
