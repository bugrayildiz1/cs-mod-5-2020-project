## Short overview:

### AT the beginning of this week we had final presentation of sprint 1, so we were concentrated on this and mainly on exam we had right before stand up meeting. we did research about back-, front-end and physical layer and settled work for upcoming week.
### We will have to decide about main programming language of the project
### For now, when there are a lot of exams coming, passing them will be our main priority, but we should not forget about project work as well.
