**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?

I prefer assigning myself the role of specialist. This is one of the results I got after completing the Belbin Role test in MOD4. I think this is the best fitting
role for myself in a team as I'm continuously researching about the field we are working in.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?

My productivity is at its highest point usually during the afternoon and evening of a day. During this time I feel the most energetic and focused while working.
In case something goes wrong, I compensate with working during late evening or night, as these periods of the day are the most stressful ones and I can easily say that I cope 
working under stress.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?

Most of the time I have a schedule where I plan all my tasks and in general the entire day. I'm trying to do everything in time and according to my schedule, but it is common for things
to go not as planned. In this situation I prioritize the task based on their deadline and relevance, i.e. completing the task with the shortest deadline and longest time required for their 
completion and then moving on to the ones that are relevant for my project progress or study progress.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?

Following the project management software that is used during the project. This is a great tool to keep track of the progress of the team and dividing the tasks among the team members.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?

Usually, I just pitch my ideas and try to be as attentive as possible to my teammates proposals. I'm challenging myself to be as active as possible during our meetings and this doesn't
mean just constant talking or interacting, but also active listening. I believe in the concept of giving feedback always and not deviating from our initial objective. Planning ahead what
should be discussed at a meeting and sticking to the plan of the meeting I believe is a great way to conduct a productive meeting.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

The requirements are generally based on 3 aspects, in my opinion. The functional requirement, nonfunctional requirement and the the objective of the application (limitations could be
included as necessary). These requirements set up the base for the planning and practical part, where the design, hardware and software of the program are implemented. We would know our
product is completed as the main objectives are completed and the scope of the application is met.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 

I believe evaluation is a great factor of motivation for a lot of people, however not for me. I tend to think that the final result of the project and the challenges I manage to get done
are way more rewarding than a grade. Once I start to make progress and develop passion for working on a project I no longer think about meeting the minimal requirements for a passing grade,
but doing my work the best I can.
