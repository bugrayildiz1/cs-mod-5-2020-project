**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
In module 4 mostly, but also prior modules, I have noticed that I am a good leader. My strenght here is that I am able to keep an overview and delegate tasks quite effectively. Next to that, I see myself as a specialist whenever the topic is something within my knowledge base. If not, then I tend to delegate the specialism, rather than diving into the subject at hand and losing overview this way.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
This is highly dependent on the intrinsic motivation I have for the problem at hand. For example, I was highly motivated for the project in module 4, becauseit was a field of TCS that I am most familiar and experienced with. This resulted in me putting in a lot of time and effort. For this project I seem (!) to beless motivated and therefore I predict that my productivity is lower. If I miscalculate and we/I get into trouble because of this, then that is frankly a consequence we/I will have to deal with and that may or may not need compensating elsewhere.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
I do not have a standardized way of prioritizing. Like mentioned before, I find my strenght in leading. This means that my main priority will always be the progress on the highest/most abstract level. 

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
Again, I have no standardized way of measuring this. Mostly, it becomes clear by our sprint methodology; overreaching or underreaching those goals is often a clear indication that there's an issue.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
Looking back at module 4 again, we often followed a natrual pattern after the stand-up. We would a certain strategy or discuss a planned step in detail, delegate tasks for these matters and finish off with some last questions/open matters. These meetings would often take about two or three hours daily (partly due to the poor planning of the staff ;-)). Feedback was always discussed and in the end we became a very effective team.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
Frankly, this is mostly determined by the requirements of the assignment/project. Generally discussing these matters filters out the too abitious ideas and polishes everything smooth. Just staying realistic is the most important.

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your colleagues? 
To be self aware of how good or bad you are doing is very important for the health of the team. I think assessing the progess from our goals is always a good rubric to assess ourselves.
