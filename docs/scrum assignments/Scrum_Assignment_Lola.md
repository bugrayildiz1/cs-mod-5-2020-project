**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.**

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
From a young age, I have been taught to be well-organized, be on time, and get things done. I value time and prefer to work efficiently to avoid wasting even a single bit of my day. Also, I pay attention to the details and always remember them to come up with the best decision in every situation. I believe the role of Implementer suits me the best since that’s exactly what I  do my whole life.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
Usually, I am being realistic with my daily productivity estimation, since I had had a lot of miscalculation with it before. Nowadays, my working day starts at 8 in the morning and might continue until 10 pm. I always try my best to be as productive as I can. It is impossible to imagine my life without having work to do. However, my productivity sometimes might fluctuate due to small external and internal factors that I couldn’t foresee. The best thing, in this case, is to eliminate the least significant task or task with the farthest deadline.

## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
It is a combination of the importance of the task and the deadlines. Also, it might depend on how much knowledge and understanding I have about what has to be done. In the worst-case scenario, it can take days to work on something, that can be simple, but completely new and out of my knowledge. So then it means I have to start earlier.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
My teammates and I always set goals for each phase of the project. So, after each phase, it can be clearly seen how much progress we have achieved.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
I think it is extremely important to bring positivity, joy, and a bit of laughter to every meeting. Be nice, work hard, make a friend – that’s always in my mind when I start working on something new. I have noticed that I spend as much time as needed and always make sure to go through the agenda, so I know what I have to work on after the meeting. Time can vary from 10 minutes to 1,5 hours.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
Since we are still in university, it all depends on minimal requirements to get a passing grade. If we successfully accomplished that, then usually we have a plan with extra features, that we might start implementing. 

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? 
Receiving feedback is always a good thing and welcome by me. It can push me to work harder or eliminate the flaws I have and never knew about. However, I am being careful with giving feedback to other people, since in my opinion, some people might not be open to it. If I know I have to, then I try to make a situation as comfortable and positive as I can.
