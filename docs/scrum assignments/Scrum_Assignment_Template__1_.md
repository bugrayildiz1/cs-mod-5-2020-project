**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## Q1: What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
I prefer to take part in the project as a Shaper. I believe that I have the characteristics to fullfill the strenghts and weaknesses for that role.
Apart from being headstrong and pretentious, the strengths are getting works to be done as quick as possible and be disposed to lead and motivate other
team members to do action. Shapers are also good at directive influence and lead the discussions in the group according to the targets that are already specified.

## Q2: How much productive you are? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?


## Q3: How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
Most of the time I create myself a prioritize matrix for the day for which has urgent, not urgent, important and not important as title.
I try to fit into that as much as I can.

## Q4: How do you follow the progress of your project?
There is a easy way to follow the progress of the project by using softwares as Jira Board and other similar softwares. In that way, every group member
can easily keep up with the updates, new tasks, new deadlines and tasks which are done.

## Q5: How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
Since meetings are for exchanging ideas and information about the project, I always try to intract with a new, unique and intelligent
ideas to be ahead from other project groups. I always prefer to end the meeting with all the members in the group so, I do not leave the meeting before the group members.
The time that I spend during meetings depends on the topic of the meeting but approximately it takes 30 minutes to 45 mintues to conclude the meeting.
At the end of the meetings, I would like to give feedback about how the meetings can be more efficient If I can realise a point about it.

## Q6: How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?

## Q7: Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues?
