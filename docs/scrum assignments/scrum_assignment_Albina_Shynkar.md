**Note: This assignment is to judge your scrum skills and how well you contribute to a team. You have to complete this form every team member individually.** 

## *Q1:* What role do you prefer for yourself as a team player and why?
*I prefer to be a plant, the person who brings new ideas in a team and manages problems in a creative way, because I am a really creative person and it is my style to manage things in creative ways. Also I would love to be coordinator because I like to check deadlines and know about what we have to do and when.*

## *Q2:* How productive are you? Can you give an estimation of your productivity? How do you manage in case your estimation goes wrong?
*Usually I can be really productive, working for the whole day in a library and doing a lot of stuff. I enjoy the process of studying and working on something in general. If my estimation goes wrong it can be because I am too tired or sick, then usually I take time for myself and start working the next day with fresh mind* 

## *Q3:* How do you prioritize your task? Do you have any specific criteria which you follow every time?
*I usually use a prioritization square for managing my tasks by identifying which ones are urgent and important, not urgent and not important.*

## *Q4:* How do you follow the progress of your project?
*During module 4 we practiced with Jira a lot and I think it is the best source to check progress of a team, know what was done and what has to be done. Also what you did so far and what other people did to understand your own progress in a team.*

## *Q5:* How do you interact in a meeting? What time generally do you spend during meetings? Would you like to give any feedback to have better meetings?
*We have meetings pretty usually, and I am always attending them, discussing topics. Usually I talk for a few minutes answering questions and for discussions for a minimum 10 minutes. Ithink our stand up meetings are good enough cause we are productively talking, thus they do not need an improvement.*

## *Q6:* How do you decide the requirements of your application? What are your criteria to decide if the product is genuinely completed?
*Requirements we decide according to the amount of time we have, budget, complicity of project. Usually it is better to set up minimal requirements to develop them later if we will have time. It is much better than raising the plank and never reaching it because of lack of time or resources. To understand the project is completed all minimal requirements have to be finished.*

## *Q7:* Do you think the evaluation is important for productivity? How do you assess yourself and your Colleagues? 
*Evaluation might be important to realize which weaknesses you have and improve your work. Some problems you might have really influence productivity so evaluation helps you to be more productive. I assess myself by comparison of my contribution to work and contribution of others. To my mind all people in team should have imaginary “normal” level of contribution so if i of someone else contribution is below this imaginary plank then some changes needed*
