## 1. Code of Conduct (Mention at least 10 Code of Conduct for your Team.)

This is expected to understand the degree of professionalism throughout the project length. It is also a kind of warning to the team members not following the conduct.

As a project team ...
* … we will not tolerate intentional rudeness or other harmful verbal communication in meetings as it affects the quality of the project.
* … we will share all the project related responsibilities equally or as we see fit otherwise.
* … we will follow the contracting rules.
* … we will be disciplined and honest throughout the project.
* … we will follow the Red/Orange card  procedure for any kind of warnings against team members, in case we find this necessary unanimously.

## 2. Project Goals? (Mention at least 5)
* Understanding the theoretical knowledge and concept that we are going to use in the project.
* Fulfilling all the functional and non-functional requirements that we set.
* Use the knowledge that we learn from the lectures in practical.
* Aim for the highest grade possible 
* Be aware of how different parts of the project interact with each other and work as a whole system
## 3. Strengths and Weaknesses (Mention at least 5)
### 3.1 Strengths
* Half of the group worked together before and is therefore very capable and efficient in collaborating
* We have divided our group by harmoniously working 3 subteams: back and front end and physical layer, which makes task dividing easier and work more efficient.
* We already experienced in how sprints should work and are familiar with workflow for such type of the project
* We have a diverse team in regard of nationality, sex, knowledge and skill.
* We are listening to each other's ideas and taking into account all thoughts.
* We are always there for each other to help with any issue at any time.
* We have good communication in messengers, where we are always welcome to ask some questions about the project or module in general.
### 3.2 Weaknesses
*  Nobody had any experience working with Raspberry Pi 
*  Due to a high workload we focus less on the project 
*  Lack of communication between  subteams
*  Since we are friends (except for Illya, he does not have friends), sometimes we lose focus and have fun instead
* Sometimes, we avoid confrontation. 
* Lack of the man, the legend, the master himself… Mister Adamo Mariani.
